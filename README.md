## Caution

/!\ If you are an Epitech student you should be aware by now that cheating is forbidden. If you are going to copy paste this code, do it at your own risks.

## Introduction
The C Modular and CPP Parts of the paradigms seminar of Epitech. Those 10 days helped us discover or rediscover the object oriented paradigm.

CPP was really fun, however I can't really say the same about C Modular.
